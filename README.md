ETL lib
====
## Installation
This is the ETL lib package.  It provides an API
to munge and prepare JSON, TSV and other data using Apache Tika and
JSON parsing/loading for ETL via Apache OODT (or other libs)
into Apache Solr.  It also provides the following command-line tools:

```
repackage
    Repackages an aggregate JSON file into its constituent data files (may use Tika).
poster
    Posts a JSON doc to Solr.
repackageandpost
	Combines repackage and posting to Solr without the need for an intermediate file.
tsvtojson
    Takes an input TSV file and parses it with a set of column headers and outputs a JSON file.
translatejson
    Takes an input JSON file and a column header file and cred file and translates from source lang to dest lang using Bing's API and Apache Tika.
```
